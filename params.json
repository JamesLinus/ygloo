{"name":"Ygloo","tagline":"Cross-platform Native SDK","body":"# Overview\r\n\r\n## Getting started\r\n\r\n### Downloading the source\r\n\r\n#### Installing repo\r\n\r\nRepo is a tool that makes it easier to work with Git for project involving a large collection of repositories. It was created and is mostly used to manage Android Open-Source codebase. For more information about Repo, see the [Developing](https://source.android.com/source/developing.html) section of Android project.\r\n\r\nYgloo is built on top of some open-source projects, and combines several projects into one platform. as such, Repo provides a convenient way to manage this collection of repositories.\r\n\r\nTo install Repo:\r\n\r\n1. Make sure you have a bin/ directory in your home directory and that it is included in your path:\r\n    ```bash\r\nmkdir ~/bin\r\nPATH=~/bin:$PATH\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Download the Repo tool and ensure that it is executable:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\ncurl https://storage.googleapis.com/git-repo-downloads/repo > ~/bin/repo\r\nchmod a+x ~/bin/repo\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### Initializing repo client\r\n\r\nAfter installing Repo, set up your client to access the Android source repository:\r\n\r\n1. Create an empty directory to hold your working files. If you're using MacOS, this has to be on a case-sensitive filesystem. Give it any name you like:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\nmkdir WORKING_DIRECTORY\r\ncd WORKING_DIRECTORY\r\n```\r\n\r\n2. Run repo init to bring down the latest version of Repo with all its most recent bug fixes. You must specify a URL for the manifest, which specifies where the various repositories included in the Android source will be placed within your working directory.\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\nrepo init -u git@github.com:yahoo/ygloo.git\r\n```\r\n    To check out a branch other than \"master\", specify it with -b:\r\n\r\n    ```bash\r\nrepo init -u git@github.com:yahoo/ygloo.git -b v0.5.0\r\n```\r\n\r\n3. When prompted, configure Repo with your real name and email address. To use the Gerrit code-review tool, you will need an email address that is connected with a registered Google account. Make sure this is a live address at which you can receive messages. The name that you provide here will show up in attributions for your code submissions.\r\n\r\nA successful initialization will end with a message stating that Repo is initialized in your working directory. Your client directory should now contain a .repo directory where files such as the manifest will be kept.\r\n\r\n#### Downloading source tree\r\n\r\nTo pull down the Ygloo source tree to your working directory from the repositories as specified in the default manifest, run\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nrepo sync\r\n```\r\n\r\nThe Ygloo Native SDK source files and build system will be located under their project names. For more about `repo sync`\r\nand other Repo commands, see the [Developing](http://source.android.com/source/developing.html) section of Android documentation.\r\n\r\n### Building\r\n\r\n#### For local host (Linux, MacOSX)\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake all\r\n```\r\n\r\nWhich is equivalent to\r\n\r\n```bash\r\nmake all native debug\r\n```\r\n\r\n#### For Android\r\n\r\nMake sure you have a variable ANDROID_HOME set to the location of Android SDK on your system.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
